## Caveats

- only lit element atm
- @customElement
- has to be exported
- @prop, methods, @event (use wc-events) - must be public
- does not follow extends or mixins
- cssprops, parts and slots must be in component definition doc

## Install

```bash
# npm
$: npm install @wcom/cli

# yarn
$: yarn add @wcom/cli

# pnpm
$: pnpm install @wcom/cli
```

## Usage
